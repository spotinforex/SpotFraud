#🕵️‍♂️ SpotFraud – Real-Time Fraud Detection Made Simple

SpotFraud is an AI-powered fraud detection app that brings real-time, intelligent decision-making to your fingertips. Built with Streamlit, it’s designed to help analysts, auditors, and data professionals catch suspicious transactions fast — without getting lost in code or complex dashboards.

Fraud doesn’t announce itself — it hides. SpotFraud surfaces hidden anomalies using powerful machine learning models that have been rigorously trained, tested, and benchmarked. Whether you’re processing thousands of bank records or just analyzing trends, SpotFraud helps you find the red flags, backed by explainable AI.

🔍 What It Does
At its core, SpotFraud takes tabular transaction data and classifies it with high precision. Just upload a CSV file, and within seconds you’ll see which transactions raise alarms — complete with fraud probability scores, feature importances, and visual diagnostics.

📂 Upload any structured dataset (CSV)

⚙️ Process it through a trained fraud detection pipeline

🧠 Get results from a Random Forest model (our best performer)

📊 Visualize anomalies, patterns, and feature importances

📝 Export flagged transactions for further investigation

🧠 How It Thinks
Behind the interface, SpotFraud is powered by a suite of trained machine learning models, including:

Random Forest Classifier 🌟 (Best performer)

LightGBM

CatBoost

Histogram-based Gradient Boosting (HistGB)

Each model was trained and validated using real-world transaction data, with extensive evaluation documented in the notebooks/Analysis Notebook.ipynb. After careful comparison, Random Forest emerged as the most accurate and reliable model for fraud classification in this setting — balancing precision, recall, and interpretability.

💻 Built With
Streamlit – Interactive UI and real-time dashboards

Scikit-learn, LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost – ML backend

Pandas & NumPy – Data handling

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Visual analytics

SHAP (optional) – Explainable AI add-on

🚨 Why It Matters
Fraud costs billions — and even small mistakes can go unnoticed for weeks. SpotFraud is designed to lower that risk by making powerful fraud detection accessible to non-technical users. It empowers your team to move from intuition to evidence, all in one sleek interface.

It’s not just another ML model — it’s a decision-support system built for clarity, speed, and trust.
